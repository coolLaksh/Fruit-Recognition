# Fruit Recognition Project

Welcome to the Fruit Recognition Project! This project aims to leverage both Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to build a system capable of recognizing various types of fruits. Whether you are a developer, data scientist, or someone passionate about fruits and technology, this project provides a platform for exploration and learning.

## Overview

The Fruit Recognition Project utilizes a combination of traditional Machine Learning algorithms and Deep Learning models to accurately identify and classify different types of fruits based on images. The project includes the following components:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse dataset of fruit images to train and test the models.

2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to enhance model performance. This may include resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and other necessary transformations.

3. **Machine Learning Models**:
    - **Decision Tree**: A simple decision tree classifier for fruit recognition.
    - **Random Forest**: An ensemble model combining multiple decision trees.
    - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Use SVM for classification tasks.
    - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Implement a KNN algorithm for fruit classification.

4. **Deep Learning Models**:
    - **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Develop a CNN for more complex feature extraction.
    - **Transfer Learning**: Utilize pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet, or MobileNet for improved performance.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fruit-recognition-project.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Data Preparation**:

    - Acquire a dataset of fruit images.
    - Organize the dataset into training and testing sets.

4. **Training**:

    - Run the scripts for each ML and DL model to train on the prepared dataset.

5. **Testing and Evaluation**:

    - Evaluate model performance using the testing dataset.
    - Adjust hyperparameters as needed.

For the dataset use this like:
